00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.120
The Headlines:

2
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.040
No smartphones?

3
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.560
No problem as taxi drivers
re-define cool.

4
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.040
Made by a Singaporean?

5
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.000
No thanks,

6
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.400
as local designers
bear the brunt of globalisation.

7
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.480
Dragons and goats are so last century.

8
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.000
Introducing the hipster zodiac.

9
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.880
Hello and welcome to The Noose.

10
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.400
I am B.B.See…

11
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.800
And I’m Xin Hua Hua.

12
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.160
Hey, ladies,

13
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.800
life without you
is a like broken pencil…

14
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.600
-pointless.
-You are pointless.

15
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.280
Topping the Noose tonight…

16
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.200
yet another variant of taxi service

17
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.880
has entered the saturated
market in Singapore.

18
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.720
A group of local cabbies,

19
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.400
who have been dubbed
“The Un-smart Uncles”,

20
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.920
are now providing a new
niche taxi service

21
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.600
that is increasingly garnering
a cult following

22
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.040
since starting 2 weeks ago.

23
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.520
Here’s Jojo Joget with the story.

24
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.520
Yet another variant of taxi service

25
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.520
has entered the saturated
market in Singapore.

26
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.320
A group of local cabbies,

27
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.960
who have been dubbed
“The Un-smart Uncles”,

28
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.400
are now providing a niche taxi service

29
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.320
that is increasingly
garnering a cult following

30
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.560
since starting 2 weeks ago.

31
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.360
The service, which has sparked a larger
anti-smartphone lifestyle movement,

32
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.080
offers customers an immersive vintage

33
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.840
and all-around nostalgic
cab-securing experience.

34
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.840
It was the brainchild of local cabbie,

35
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.480
Nicholas Le Fong, and friends

36
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.520
and some friends
who found themselves

37
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.600
at the shorter end of the stick

38
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.920
as non-smartphone-owning taxi drivers.

39
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.960
Actually,

40
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.920
I’ve considered getting
a smartphone for a long time,

41
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.760
but my wife don’t let me
get the smartphone

42
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.800
because she is scared
I go online and start gambling.

43
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.880
But I tell you, one main reason
that I want to get a smartphone

44
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.320
is because I am always
losing out to all these apps:

45
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.080
Grab, Uber, Graber...don’t know ah.

46
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.320
So many of my friends also
don't have smartphones

47
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.880
because we all have cock-up fingers,

48
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.080
some of us the fingers too fat,

49
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.360
some too skinny,

50
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.000
some the finger always shaking.

51
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.160
We are all old-school chaps

52
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.560
and many of us out there

53
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.320
are losing out because
of this thing, you know.

54
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.480
So one day, I sat down
with my friends, drinking coffee,

55
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.160
we talked about this thing.

56
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.280
We said enough is enough.

57
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.360
We cannot be penalised
just because of our cock-up fingers.

58
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.760
People use all these apps because
they want make a statement,

59
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.720
trying to act cool only,
it’s usually not even cheaper!

60
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.920
So we thought to ourselves,

61
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.960
we must start our own lifestyle brand,

62
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.040
come up with our own pattern!
I show you.

63
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.640
You see?

64
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.040
Nicholas Le Fong and his friends

65
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.640
then started to display their
phone numbers at the back of their cabs

66
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.040
so that customers could personally
call and book them.

67
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.560
This practice grew popular amongst
non-smartphone-using cabbies

68
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.600
and became a big hit with local
hipster millennials

69
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.880
who are relishing the new
“alternative” cab-securing trend.

70
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.000
You see, whenever I make a phone call,

71
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.880
it is really just to hear this tone.

72
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.400
It’s so good, right?

73
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.640
This waiting process is all part of the
experience, you understand.

74
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.800
I love it.

75
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.760
You see,

76
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.800
my friends and I are really into
this “farm-to-table” cabbie concept,

77
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.720
through all this minimal processing
of phone apps and whatnot.

78
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.240
It is a very down-to-earth and
personal approach

79
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.800
that really brings me back to a time

80
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.560
when life was much more relaxed
and down-to-earth.

81
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.920
The movement has even inspired
many followers of the movement

82
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.720
to give up their smartphones for simpler,

83
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.320
more retro 7/11 prepaid phones.

84
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.360
There are also plans to call out
new service features,

85
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.080
such as taxi booking via pagers
for VIP customers

86
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.240
and reserved spots on pavements

87
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.600
for VVIP customers to hail cabs from.

88
00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.360
So I really hope I get to
VVVVVVVVVIP status one day.

89
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.240
I mean, I just think it’s a very fulfilling
experience, spiritually, I mean,

90
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.640
to wait at least 10 minutes for a cab
just like in the good old days.

91
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.920
In a way, it is also
a silent protest you know,

92
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.040
against the capitalist modern society,

93
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.680
where they are constantly telling you,

94
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.640
they want more of this,
and more of that,

95
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.720
more of this, more of that.

96
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.280
Quicker, faster!

97
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.680
Honestly, at the end of the day,

98
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.000
it’s all about being grateful,

99
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.040
and embracing “less is more”.

100
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.000
But isn’t that an iPhone 7?

101
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.080
Yes, but I also have
2 vintage 2004 Nokias.

102
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.920
Those who are interested in
becoming a part of the community

103
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.560
should delete all taxi apps
from one’s phone,

104
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.000
and then hit the curb

105
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.880
in search of an elusive, un-smart taxi.

106
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.600
Reporting for The Noose,

107
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.040
this is Jojo Joget.

108
00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.000
I have no idea why they’re called
smartphones…

109
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.280
if anything, they seem to be making
people more stupid by the day.

110
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.320
Speaking of "stupid",

111
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.600
it seems Singaporeans aren’t just
capable of appreciating good things

112
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.680
created by their fellow countrymen.

113
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.480
It seems that if you
want to make it in Singapore,

114
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.880
you have to be a success overseas first.

115
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.120
Our reporter, Jacques Ooi,
recently met one such fashion designer.

116
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.560
When she was in primary school,

117
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.080
Juraidah Amin’s teachers
never failed to say this

118
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.520
every year in her report book…

119
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.640
She is a dreamer.

120
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.920
I mean, what kind of a remark is

121
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.720
“She’s a day dreamer”?

122
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.000
Did they mean I was an idealist?

123
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Or did they mean to say that
I was day dreaming too much?

124
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.080
Maybe those teachers should have
made their classes more interesting.

125
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.480
Fortunately for Juraidah,

126
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.560
rather than take that
comment as a negative,

127
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.920
her parents encouraged their
only daughter to follow her dreams.

128
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.480
Which she did, pursuing a course
in fashion design

129
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.360
after finishing the 'O' levels.

130
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.680
But for many creative types,

131
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.560
trying to find acceptance
and an audience for their work

132
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.800
proved to be more difficult
than she imagined.

133
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.760
But after 4 years of
dogged perseverance,

134
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.880
she finally hit pay dirt.

135
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.280
A London-based fashion designer
saw a couple of my designs

136
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.080
and offered me a job.

137
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.560
After 2 years of mentoring me,

138
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.600
he helped me with the launch of my
own clothing line called "JUAM".

139
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.000
Because "JUraidah AMin"...so, JUAM.

140
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.040
Everybody thought it was Spanish

141
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.440
and I also kept a low profile,

142
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.120
and just let the clothes
speak for themselves.

143
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.520
The label had a cult following in Europe.

144
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.720
So then, after a while,
I decided to try my luck

145
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.280
back in Singapore
by opening a small boutique.

146
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.720
And rich Singaporeans
fell in love with it,

147
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.400
paying thousands of dollars
for my own dresses.

148
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.920
But with the brand
enjoying wild success,

149
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.800
the press began to ask
questions, such as,

150
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.880
who is behind the success of the label?

151
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.520
When Juraidah finally relented and
did an interview to tell her story,

152
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.840
her sales in Singapore plummeted.

153
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.080
They said, “Why should I pay so much

154
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.080
for something made by a local person?”

155
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.120
My sales plunged by 90 percent.

156
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.440
I even had to close down my boutique

157
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.560
because I couldn’t afford
the rental anymore.

158
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.360
Now, I only have a tiny rack of clothes
in this residential area.

159
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.600
Some say it’s unfair
to paint Singaporeans

160
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.800
as a bunch of snobs
who don’t support local talent,

161
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.680
but it's true, isn’t it?

162
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.240
They point to other home-grown labels

163
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.880
that have enjoyed tremendous success.

164
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.800
So...what gives?

165
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.680
I would attribute this attitude

166
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.520
of all things foreign being good

167
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.960
to globalisation.

168
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.680
You can see this manifest itself
here in Singapore,

169
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.360
in terms of food.

170
00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.040
You know, people don’t mind going to
a mid-tier, but crappy restaurant,

171
00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.080
and paying $15 for a “pasta”

172
00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.360
that has nothing else but

173
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.560
tomato puree and minced beef.

174
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.400
But then, look at the hawker who sells
<i>bak chor mee (minced meat noodle);

175
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.240
it has two times the ingredients

176
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.640
and requires five times
the amount of skill.

177
00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:38.440
Yet when this hawker wants to
increase prices by 50 cents,

178
00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.360
everybody screams murder!

179
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.080
It’s so tragic.

180
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.160
Everyone just KPKB.

181
00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.880
And there you have it.

182
00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.560
This is Jacques Ooi

183
00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.200
reporting for The Noose.

184
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.720
Time for a quick breather.

185
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.200
Coming up…

186
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.720
hipsters unveil a new line-up
of zodiac animals

187
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.000
to bring Chinese New Year

188
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.080
into the 21st century.

189
00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.400
Stop it.

190
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.760
Hello and welcome back to The Noose.

191
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.440
We’re just two weeks away
from the Lunar New Year,

192
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:32.440
but many young Singaporeans are
already groaning about the prospect

193
00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.440
of having to wear something red

194
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.280
and going through the motions
of celebrating the festivities.

195
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.400
In a bid to modernise
the Lunar New Year celebrations,

196
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.880
the Board of Cultural Management

197
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.120
has come up with
several recommendations,

198
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.240
including a new roster of zodiac animals.

199
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.960
Here’s Andre Chichak with the story.

200
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.840
<i>Gong xi ah gong xi,</i>
(Congratulations ah congratulations)

201
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.880
<i>fa ya fa da chai</i>
(Let’s prosper with lots of money)

202
00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.440
Common lyrics to an often-played
Chinese New Year song

203
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.600
that can be heard all over Singapore

204
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.600
from posh shopping centres

205
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.440
to heartland malls,
and even on the radio.

206
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.080
While the older generation
sees these festive tunes

207
00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.800
as an uplifting sign that Chinese
New Year is just around the corner,

208
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.720
many young Singaporeans do not
share their enthusiasm for the holiday.

209
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.920
Well, you know what I’m saying?
Like, you know,

210
00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.320
like red totally clashes horrendously
with like my skin-tone,

211
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.720
you know, what I’m saying?

212
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.600
Like, everything about this holiday
is totally like red,

213
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.240
you know what I’m saying?

214
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.240
Like, you know,
like the clothes are like red,

215
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.080
like the decorations are like totally red.

216
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.160
Even like, you know,

217
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.480
the money envelopes...
they are like red,

218
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.120
you know what I’m saying, right?

219
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.200
It totally doesn’t even match

220
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.680
the blue notes you are
supposed to get in it.

221
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.080
Right, you know what I’m saying?

222
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.280
I hate my relatives.

223
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.080
In a bid to appeal to millennials
and prevent traditions from dying out,

224
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.720
the Board of Cultural Management
or BOCUM

225
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.480
has put together a taskforce

226
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.520
of well-known social media
personalities and hipster influencers

227
00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.600
to make CNY cool again.

228
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.560
The Creative Taskforce of Influencers
aims to make Chinese New Year

229
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.280
a more relatable festival for
young Singaporeans.

230
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.040
After countless meetings
over artisanal coffee,

231
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.640
we’ve come to the conclusion

232
00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.440
that the holiday needs
a major overhaul.

233
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.440
For example, red...out,

234
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.200
Rose Quartz is in.

235
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.720
Lion dance...out,

236
00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.840
Internet cat dance is in.

237
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.080
But the pièce de résistance
of the entire plan

238
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.520
is to revamp the 12 zodiac signs,

239
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.760
because, come on, let’s face it,

240
00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.920
the basic animals are just so lame.

241
00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.280
The 12 new proposed animals
for the zodiac are

242
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.160
Cat,

243
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.040
Owl,

244
00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.040
Hedgehog,

245
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.320
Fennec Fox,

246
00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.480
Koala Bear,

247
00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.520
Panda Bear,

248
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.520
Penguin,

249
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.600
Alpaca,

250
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.720
Guinea Pig,

251
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.920
Slow Loris,

252
00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:04.920
Sloth,

253
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.280
and as a tribute to the Bishan 10,

254
00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.320
Otter.

255
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.680
The committee has also included a
‘How to Answer Judgey Relatives’ guide,

256
00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.720
which includes responses like,

257
00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.920
“I’m not married yet because
I look at your spouse

258
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.520
and fear that bad judgement
runs in the family.”

259
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.760
And “Children? Sure!

260
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.400
I’m not ready, but hey,

261
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.040
what’s life without
decades-long resentment?”

262
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.760
No word just yet on whether BOCUM
will accept their recommendations,

263
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.200
but sources say it is likely to go through

264
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.960
as authorities are afraid

265
00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.080
that they will be slammed
on social media

266
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.280
if they criticise the proposal.

267
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.040
This is Andre Chichak,

268
00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.120
The Noose.

269
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.040
Millennials in the workforce

270
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.360
have become a concern
for many employers.

271
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.760
Referring to those born after 1985,

272
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.840
the millennial generation grew up
with the internet

273
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.440
and adopted extremely
different values

274
00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.640
from the previous generation,

275
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.960
some of whom have compared
them to strawberries,

276
00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.880
others, to durians.

277
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.240
But as Bertha Haryani finds out,

278
00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.040
help is on the way to assist employers

279
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.440
learn about dealing with millennials.

280
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.800
Millennials in the workforce have become
a concern for many employers.

281
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.720
Referring to those born after 1985,

282
00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.400
the millennial generation grew up
with the internet

283
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.640
and adopted extremely different
values from the previous generation,

284
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.160
some of whom have compared
them to strawberries,

285
00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.120
and others, durians.

286
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.320
Millennial...

287
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.880
they are like the
<i>Liu Sha Bao, or Salted Egg Crab;

288
00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.120
they are very interesting,

289
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.680
but, actually, they are not good for
everyday when you are working.

290
00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.160
Too heaty, will get sore throat.

291
00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.080
They are all idiots, lah.

292
00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.680
Who will pay $8 for a cup of coffee?

293
00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.880
In my time, $8...you can rent
a four-room flat, you know!

294
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.400
I think, I think, like, you know,

295
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.400
the older generation,
like my parents, your parents,

296
00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.680
our teachers, your teachers,

297
00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.280
they don’t try to understand us,

298
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.880
and then they think we are dumb,
but we are not dumb.

299
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.920
We care so much about
social issues, you know,

300
00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.040
like the inclusiveness, diversiveness,

301
00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.920
feminism, millennialism...
all these things.

302
00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.560
And then, a lot of other
social issues, like...

303
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.000
impact of Brexit,

304
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.400
American election,

305
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.000
environment,

306
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.480
plastic...

307
00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.200
Oh my gosh, Ben is on!

308
00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.920
Ben Kheng is on Snapchat.

309
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.000
We have to do this together.
Can I show him?

310
00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.080
There is a clear generational gap.

311
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.600
In order to create a workforce
of one united people,

312
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.880
regardless of race, language

313
00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.320
or preferred social media platform,

314
00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.600
the Ministry of Manpower
is rolling out new courses

315
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.960
to help employers communicate
with millennials.

316
00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.040
As the Chief Millennial Officer,

317
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.840
I have done a lot of research

318
00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.480
to help civil servants
convey their message

319
00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.680
of helping the young-at-heart

320
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.520
reach out to the actually young at heart.

321
00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.960
You see, in the past, right,

322
00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.200
we have helped the best generation

323
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.760
convey their ideas in ways which

324
00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.400
the new generation can understand,

325
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.240
including the MDA rap,

326
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.720
using Gangnam Style for
every single video

327
00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.560
that we have produced since 2012,

328
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.680
and we are now preparing

329
00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.920
a Pen-Papaya-Apple-Pen video

330
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:48.080
to talk about including fruits in the diet.

331
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.360
According to Artisanal Lim,

332
00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.920
there has been a gulf between how
employers and the government

333
00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.280
have been communicating
with the millennials,

334
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.560
leading to a communication breakdown
and generation gap.

335
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.960
This can be improved by tapping
on all things new,

336
00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.480
trendy and faddish,
which all the millennials enjoy.

337
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:15.680
If you think about it, the Five-Step
Mozzie Wipeout is ineffective.

338
00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:19.480
The word "wipe-out",
reminds people of "work-out",

339
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.880
as in the Great Singapore Workout.

340
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.160
And this is considered a rather obiang,

341
00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.840
archaic way to communicate, right?

342
00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:31.640
Instead, the NEA should
phrase it in such a way

343
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.600
that millennials can enjoy,
like in a Buzzfeed kind of way.

344
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.600
For example, they can say,

345
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.640
“Twelve Unexpected Places
Water Can Accumulate

346
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.920
and Cause the Breeding of
Dengue-and Zika-spreading Viruses.

347
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.080
Number 2, 5 and 11
is really true for me!"

348
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.160
You see, that way
millennials will actually click and read!

349
00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.480
Finally, millennials no longer
want to sing about

350
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.600
"Where the River Always Flows".

351
00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.600
Nor do they want to "Chant Mali Chan".

352
00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.640
So going forward, all national day songs

353
00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.560
will be written and performed by...
get this…

354
00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.000
K-pop stars!

355
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.120
And it will come with
full choreography,

356
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.480
so that millennials can dance it at Scape,

357
00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.640
even when it is not National Day.

358
00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.560
Actually, we have already adopted

359
00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.800
several popular anthems for our ministry.

360
00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.920
Like, for the Singapore
Kindness movement,

361
00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.440
we have adopted
Super Junior’s "Sorry, Sorry"

362
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:35.080
and the Ministry of Social and
Family Development

363
00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.080
will be encouraging families
to have more babies

364
00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.280
using Big Bang’s "Fantastic Baby"...

365
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.400
suitable for all small spaces.

366
00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.080
This is Bertha Haryani,

367
00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.800
reporting for The Noose.

368
00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.280
Let's go home!

369
00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.160
If you don’t want to see those,

370
00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.920
head to toggle.sg/thenoose

371
00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:00.720
to catch up on any past episodes
you might have missed.

372
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.040
We’ll be right back.

373
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.880
Hello and thanks for staying with us
here on the Noose.

374
00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.360
The heavy metal band, Metallica,

375
00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.080
is due to perform in Singapore
in a month’s time...

376
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.680
their second gig here in 3 years.

377
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.520
And as Jojo Joget finds out,

378
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.680
besides boisterous
and rebellious young adults,

379
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.680
the band also does have some
dedicated followers in high places.

380
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.240
<i>Take my hand</i>

381
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.520
<i>off to never never land!</i>

382
00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.040
How can you not like that music?

383
00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.480
You are not rock enough.

384
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.360
Call yourself a producer, some more.

385
00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.040
Oh, we're ‘on’ already.

386
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.920
One of the most influential

387
00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.240
heavy metal bands of all time, Metallica,

388
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:04.840
is set to return to perform in Singapore
at the Indoor Stadium.

389
00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.280
Since the announcement of the concert,

390
00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.800
fans around the island

391
00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.920
have been professing their love
for Metallica’s music

392
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.440
and the influence it has on their lives.

393
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.440
I’ve been a Metallica fan since 1986!

394
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.680
I have all their albums on vinyl,

395
00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.600
way before buying vinyl
was considered cool.

396
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.520
I mean, these youngsters...
they listen to indie these days.

397
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.640
They don’t understand, you know,

398
00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.520
they don’t realise
they need music like Metallica

399
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.840
to keep them alive!

400
00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.960
They listen to what? Gentle Bones.
We don’t need gentle bones,

401
00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.600
we need metal...metal in our blood!

402
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.720
Like my hero, Harry, once said,

403
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.880
whoever governs Singapore
must have that iron in him!

404
00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:49.640
Fans of Metallica and their music
know no boundaries.

405
00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.400
But one surprising person
who is a dedicated fan,

406
00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:57.960
is none other than our own
Minister at Large, Esmond Wan.

407
00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.680
Actually, I’ve always been
a big fan of the Metallica.

408
00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.200
Their music has always
influenced me personally

409
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.320
and shows us how we can run
the government here.

410
00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.520
Take for example, their fourth album,

411
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.200
“And Justice for All”.

412
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.760
It is not just an album;

413
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.240
it is also about our judicial system

414
00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.560
and how we run our supreme court.

415
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:26.160
And also, what about “Ride the Lightning”?

416
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.200
That is a personal favourite of my
esteemed colleagues and me.

417
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.960
And it is also a song about riding
the train to work…

418
00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.040
if it does not break down.

419
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.600
Then there is also “Master of Puppets”.

420
00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.720
That one is a personal favourite

421
00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.080
for the party!

422
00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:50.240
Despite the band’s mainstream
success in recent years,

423
00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.920
there is a pocket of rock music fans

424
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.960
who are not too excited
by Metallica’s return

425
00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.680
to our sunny shores for the third time.

426
00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.600
Noisy ah, bro…

427
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.120
I like rock music,

428
00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.480
but I like the type of music

429
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.240
where you can, at least,
hear what the singer is singing,

430
00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.360
like Bob Marley's “Three Little Birds”.

431
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:16.800
Their music is so fast and sound like
they are so angry all the time.

432
00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.400
That type of music, how to play

433
00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.800
when you are trying to romance your
girlfriend at Pasir Ris Park, you tell me?

434
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:29.160
At least the other bands,
like Scorpion and Whitesnake,

435
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.000
you can still, at least, sing along

436
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.440
and they have rock ballads

437
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.760
where you can play different
cover versions at weddings.

438
00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.760
Then you can play
the guitar with feeling.

439
00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.440
That is what rock music
is all about…feeling,

440
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.880
not like that...fast and furious.

441
00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.400
I bet this bugger thinks

442
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.560
Michael Learns to Rock
is also a hard rock band.

443
00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.440
Eh, go relax one corner.

444
00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.640
Rock never die, okay.

445
00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.720
Reporting for The Noose,

446
00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.320
this is Jojo Joget.

447
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.360
I think better go buy a ticket.

448
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.280
And that brings us to the end
of this edition of The Noose.

449
00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.680
I’m B.B.See.

450
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.480
And I’m Xin Hua Hua,

451
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.680
just a Master of Puppets.

452
00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.240
Good night.

453
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.880
I'm a smooth operator.

454
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.080
Haven't you noticed
I haven't been spitting in my cup

455
00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.600
for the last couple of hours?
